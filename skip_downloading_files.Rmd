First, you'll need to load the `RCurl` package. If you've never used this package before, you'll want to install it from it's [CRAN page](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCurl/index.html)

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
if(!require(RCurl)) install.packages("RCurl") # If missing package, install from CRAN
```

<br>

## Steps

Instead of downloading the dataset manually, right-click on the download option and copy the *Link Address*. You can plug this directly into the `getURL()` function from RCurl.

```{r}
## Use RCurl to download the dataset from medicare.gov API 
url <- getURL("https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/c7us-v4mf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD")
```


<br>


Since the url object is the csv file as a string, we'll use `textConnection(url)` to read the results as a text file. Finally, we use the `read.csv()` function to read the connection into R.

```{r}
# Read in the CSV  as a csv 
hosp <- read.csv(file = textConnection(url))
str(hosp)
```
