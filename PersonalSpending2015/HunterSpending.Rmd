This is a quick demonstration of how R can be utilized for (non-professional) 
visualization of personal finances. This is totally off the cuff, and I don't have
any plans to "complete" this project at any time!

```{r Read the Google Sheet}
# SOURCE: https://goo.gl/IM2ZsE (login required)
Spend <- gs_title("BoA 2015") %>% 
  gs_read_csv("2015") %>% 
  select(-Original.Description, -Classification, -Status) %>%
  mutate(Date = ymd(Date))
```

Here's a quick figure illustrating my spending by category, by month:

```{r, fig.height=14, fig.width=8}
Spend %>% 
  filter(Amount<0, Simple.Description!="Transfer") %>%
  mutate(Month = month(Date, label=T)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Category, y=-Amount, fill=Category)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
  facet_wrap("Month", scales = "free_x") + 
  labs(y="Spent ($)", title="Spending by Category, by Month") +
  theme_UT() + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = -90)) + 
  guides(fill=F)
```

In this figure, you can see how much money I have available in my 
checking account, plotted over the day of the month. 

```{r}
Spend %>% 
  group_by(Account.Name) %>%
  mutate(Running = order_by(Date, cumsum(Amount))) %>%
  ungroup() %>% filter(Account.Name=="CheckingAccount0180") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=mday(Date), y=Running)) + 
  geom_jitter(aes(color=month(Date, label=T))) + 
  labs(x="Day of the Month", y="Money in the bank ($)") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Spectral", name="")+
  theme_UT()
```
